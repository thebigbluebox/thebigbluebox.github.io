##### The project that I did at this year's MHack6

This year at Michigan University's 6th hackathon, MHack6, my partner (Ryan) and I set out to make a web application that made it simple for users to find which location
from your different job offers will best fit your choice of savings, comfort, and safety.

The web application that we designed is composed of several different pieces of technology, lets list the stack now
* Node JS
* Express
* Jade
* IBM Watson Trade Off analytics

So how does all of these things work together? Lets dive in with this section by section explanation

##### What is IBM Watson Trade Off Analytics?
As you all have heard about IBM's own prodigy, whose name is Watson, it is also the super computer that
beat out the champions of Jepordy in 2011. Now we actually utilize its framework and its skills in our
application to make the better decision based on different factors.

Watson's trade off analytics is only one of several watson api's that you can access through the IBM
Bluemix service. What trade off analytics offers is the ability to perform an aggregation of data
through different sets of indexes and return the best set of data
