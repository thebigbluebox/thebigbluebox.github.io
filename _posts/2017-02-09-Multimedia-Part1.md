# What is a Pan Head

The camera has been around capturing human activity for over a century. 
However usage of a camera to document things over time has only been perfected recently with the ease of use of modern digital cameras.
With timelapses being a way to document the change over a certain period of time.
The most common way is to use a static mounted tripod that does not move paired up with the camera to take pictures over certain intervals; thus generating a stream of images that captures a subject in clarity over time. But certain artists have started using moving rails with sophisticated panning mechanisms to give their timelapse a certain feel of smoothly moving the shot over time; giving traditional timelapses a new look. For this project our group will be attempting at recreating the pan head of the equipment which can cost upwards of [$1500](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&sku=992582&gclid=CPCA7LKQj9ICFdO3wAoda_YMPg&is=REG&c3api=1876%2C72666235682%2C%2C&A=details&Q=&pcur=CAD) and as cheap as [$100](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1244757-REG/revo_eph_6_electronic_panoramic_head.html) dollars.

The shots with the panning head adds motion and energy to a time lapse unlike how it was static before hand.

# What is a Timelapse Dolly

In addition to the panning mechnism, our group will also attempt to mimic a timelapse capable dolly/slider that can cost anywhere between [$100](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1204480-REG/revo_rs_850af_v2_camera_track_slider_v2.html) to [$1500](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1164222-REG/rhino_sku121_essentials_slider_bundle_with.html) depending on the build quality.
Camera sliders are used quite frequently in films and documents for a variety of reasons.
Often, there is a landscape that is just too wide to be captured in only one shot so a camera slider will be used in order to capture the whole setting while retaining a proper quality.
But for a timelapse, this sliding motion adds a new dimension and depth into a static timelapse, it allows the camera to move to new locations while still recording the changes in the environment over long span of time.

# Concepts and Ideas

The basic concept behind a gimbal is to have the object (camera) in this case stay in place while it rotates on a single axis. For simplicity of this project we decided that it would be best if we just worked on the rotation in the x-axis. In order to achieve this goal we required an object which could rotate slow enough so that it is still acceptable as a timelapse and have it stay in place while the camera itself were to slowly pan. With some brainstorming we discovered that a basic mechanical egg timer with a rotating face seemed like the perfect tool for this DIY project. In theory the small rotation provided by the egg timer would mimic a still pan necessary for timelapses and we should be able to make it so that the face is locked in place so only the body is capable of rotating. We would then need a means of attachment for the camera to go on the egg timer. We don't want to attach the camera directly as this would prove to be a hassle in the future to remove so a suitable base will most likely be needed. 

Traditionally a camera slider works via a rail system in which there is base which would slide up and down the rail in a smooth fashion. However, these sliders are rather large and seem like a hassle to carry around so for our slider we hoped to create one with less material providing more portability. We plan to mimic the effects of slider by using the force of an automated object to hopefully push or move the gimbal and camera setup as if it were on the rails of a slider. One of the ideas for the object is an wind-up car in which we could attach our makeshift gimbal on top and have it move in a straight motion.

# Prototype 1 Gimbal / Slider

Item | Cost | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
Egg timer | $3.00 | The main part of the panning head
Pullback car | $1.00 | What will power the dolly
Dowels | $1.00 | The tracks for the pullback car to follow
Total | $5.00 | 

From the dollar store we managed to gather most of our main materials. 
To set up the gimble we needed to attach the camera, specifically a GoPro in our case, to the egg timer. We did this via painter’s tape and surprisingly the tape held the GoPro fairly well in place even capable of holding it upside down. 

Once the GoPro was secured in place we needed to hold the egg timer in place so that only the top half would rotate providing the steady pan for timelapses. We achieved this by attaching two dowels to the front face of the egg timer which would complete our first prototype of the gimbal.

We tested to see if the gimbal actually did work. And [here]() is a sample link to our footage that I captured.

After, reviewing the video it seemed like our makeshift gimbal was functioning properly providing a slow enough pan to create suitable timelapses.

### Issues
Moving onto our slider we ran into some issues. First, the wind-up car we planned to use had an awkward shape so this made it difficult to attach. To resolve this issue we removed the casing that was attached to the car and only took the chassis of the toy car which had the wind-up mechanism.

Moreover, the dowels which we had attached earlier proposed a new problem. The dowels kept interfering with the attachment to the chassis of the car and needed to be removed in order to get the GoPro onto the car. We began to reassess our design.

# Prototype 2 Gimbal / Slider

Item | Cost | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
Egg timer | $3.00 | The main part of the panning head
~Pullback car~| ~ $1.00 ~| ~What will power the dolly~
Mouse Trap | $2.00 | Will power 
Dowels | $1.00 | The tracks for the pullback car to follow
Total | $7.00 | 

Due to issues with the previous prototype we needed a redesign of our two objectives. This time we went with a simpler approach. The tape we used to attach the GoPro to the egg timer was unexpectedly strong so we took a risk in assuming that it would be strong enough to hold in place the timer much like the dowels. Surprisingly, our hypothesis was correct and the tape was indeed strong enough to hold the timer in place so we directly attached it to the chassis of the car.

### Issues
Although, we managed to solve the problem with attachment we ran into yet another issue. Due to the car’s simplistic gear mechanism and mainly hollow shell that we removed it didn’t take us long to figure out that the force provided by the wind-up car was not strong enough to move our gimbal setup.

After, observing that the car’s wind-up gear mechanism would not suffice we needed to re-evaluate how we could get the gimbal to move as if it were on a slider.

# Problems we approach

The first problem we found was with the egg timer which had a hook on the rotator dial. This was an issue because we needed a solid flat base to attach the gopro on the rotator dial, so to fix this issue we decided to cut off the hook to have a stable base. 

Another problem that arose was that as we were working through assembling the camera gimbal we noticed that the weight of the gopro was too heavy for the toy car to provide the straight motion. To resolve this issue we decided to change the base by using a mouse trap to support the weight of the gopro and help with straight motion slider. 

Two of the biggest problems we had while assembling the camera gimbal was to get it to move on it’s own down the slider. To fix this issue we used mouse trap which was disassembled, cardboard, tape and a hanger was used with the toy car that was placed on the cardboard to get the sliding movement on it’s own. 

The other problem was getting the gopro camera to rotate while sliding down at a steady speed. These were the major problems that arose while assembling the camera gimbal.
