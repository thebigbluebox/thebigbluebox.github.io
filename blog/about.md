#Hello

##My name is Tai Rui Tong, but you can just call me Terry.

I'm passionate about software development and design, for me these two are at the core of my life and I can't imagine a world without good design or software to empower us humans. My current interests revolves in building web applications, mobile applications, and creating a solid user experience through development of intuitive UI's. If you would like to know more about my experiences I would defintely suggest my linkedin. 

With all the serious stuff at top, I also like to dabble in:

- Photoshop, Illustrator, anything to let me draw those stick figures on my computer

- Photography

- Swimming

- Running for really long distances!

- Also enjoy watching people perform magic tricks
