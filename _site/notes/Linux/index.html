        <p>#Linux Basics
Things I learned from just reading linux essentials</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pwd print working directory shows current path</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ls-list-what-is-currently-in-our-directory">Ls list what is currently in our directory</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Ls [option] [directory]</li>
  <li>-l flag is long listing</li>
  <li>drwxr-xr-x  12 TaiRui  staff   408  4 Apr 19:46 Applications
    <ul>
      <li>D &lt;-directory type if nothing there it is not a directory</li>
      <li>RWXR permissions</li>
      <li>12 -&gt; number of blocks</li>
      <li>TaiRui owner of the directory / file</li>
      <li>Group that the owner is part of</li>
      <li>File size in MiB</li>
      <li>The time it was last changed</li>
      <li>Folder name / File name
# Paths</li>
      <li>Absolute which are absolute locations based from your home level ~
   ○ Relative which can be achieved from current / or from above ../, or from your user home level ~
   ○ And change directories using cd [directory]</li>
      <li>Important folders in your NIX system
   ○ /etc -&gt; stores configuration files for the system
   ○ /var/log -&gt; stores logs for various system components
   ○ /bin -&gt; location of several commonly used programs
   ○ /usr/bin -&gt; Another location for programs [http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5915/difference-between-bin-and-usr-bin]</li>
      <li>Everything is a file in UNIX
   ○ Everything in a NIX system is a file, this was set as a core principal design
   ○ File extensions don’t matter to the system, as it relies on the file header within the file to tell the nix system what type of file it is
        <ul>
          <li>We can check a file’s type using the file command
   ○ Files are case sensitive and even commands are case sensitive as well
   ○ Spaces!</li>
          <li>How do we deal with spaces in the file or directory? Either by using quotes cd ‘Family Photos’</li>
          <li>Or via an escape character cd Family\ Photos the escape was the \ &lt;- there is a space after that escape character
   ○ Hidden files in nix systems all begin with a full stop period, so in your home directory configurations can be seen by doing a ls -a</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Man Pages
   ○ Man [command] which will show you a list of all configuration with the command shows you how to use it
   ○ Searching can be done with man -k <keyword> or while in a man page /<keyword> then press n to browse next and next</keyword></keyword></li>
      <li>File and Directory Manipulation
   ○ Mkdir [options] <directory>
</directory>        <ul>
          <li>The creation of directory</li>
          <li>-p will create the parent directory if you where to create a directory /parent1/folder</li>
          <li>-v will log the creation of the folders</li>
          <li>-pv combination p and v, lol so we list out the creation of multiple parent folders and such
   ○ Rmdir removes the directory =
   ○ Touch [option] <file> we don't just create a file we TOUCH ONE 
   ○ Cp copying a file or folder</file></li>
          <li>Cp source_file new_file</li>
          <li>Cp -r source_folder new_folder
   ○ MV moving a file or folder</li>
          <li>Mv source file new_source_location</li>
          <li>Mv -r source_folder new_source_location_folder</li>
          <li>To rename we can just do the same for moving folders and files just change the name
   ○ Rm removes a file</li>
          <li>Rm [option] <file></file></li>
          <li>Rm -r &lt;- removes recursively</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Command line Text Editors
   ○ Vi - Vim the thing that everyone is scared of
        <ul>
          <li>Open a file vi [options] <file.txt></file.txt></li>
          <li>Read only view <file.txt></file.txt></li>
          <li>Text commands
      □ i will change the opened mode to insertion mode which allows for the modification of the file
      □ ZZ save and exit
      □ :q! quit don’t save
      □ :w save
      □ :wq save and quit
      □ Arrow keys - move the cursor around
      □ j, k, h, l - move the cursor down, up, left and right (similar to the arrow keys)
      □ ^ (caret) - move cursor to beginning of current line
      □ $ - move cursor to end of the current line
      □ nG - move to the nth line (eg 5G moves to 5th line)
      □ G - move to the last line
      □ w - move to the beginning of the next word
      □ nw - move forward n word (eg 2w moves two words forwards)
      □ b - move to the beginning of the previous word
      □ nb - move back n word
      □ { - move backward one paragraph
      □ } - move forward one paragraph
      □ x - delete a single character
      □ nx - delete n characters (eg 5x deletes five characters)
      □ dd - delete the current line
      □ dn - d followed by a movement command. Delete to where the movement command would have taken you. (eg d5w means delete 5 words)
      □ u - Undo the last action (you may keep pressing u to keep undoing)
      □ U (Note: capital) - Undo all changes to the current line
   ○ Cat (concatenate) -&gt; used to view files and logs right in the cmdline
   ○ Less -&gt; used to view large files with ability to scroll</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wildcards
   ○ *  All seeing star, matches n characters of whatever
   ○ ? Matches one unknown character ?A* matches the second letter with A
   ○ [] range operator, matches any letter within the specified range ?[sv]* matches second letter with either s or v or [0-9] matches numbers from 0-9</li>
      <li>Permissions
   ○ 3 things for a file
        <ul>
          <li>Read [r]</li>
          <li>Write [w]</li>
          <li>Execute [x]
   ○ 3 different types of permissions</li>
          <li>Owner single person owns the file, permission could be granted to other users to access the file</li>
          <li>Group</li>
          <li>Others 
   ○ Chmod to change the permission to the file</li>
          <li>3 components : 
      □ Who are we changing the permission for user, owner or all? 
      □ Are we granting or revoking permissions
      □ Which permission are we setting (R W X)</li>
          <li>And we can do short hand such as 777 which in octal speak will set the individual bit values for the permissions at the [owner,group,others] group, and within that the bit representation of the value is used to determine the permission level</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Filters
   ○ Filter is a program that  accepts textual data and transforms it in a particular way
   ○ Head prints out the head of the document up to n number of lines
   ○ Tail prints out the bottom of the document up to n number of lines
   ○ Sort sorts the printout of the document by default alphabetically
   ○ Nl shows line numbers for the print out
   ○ Wc word count, character count.. Etc look in man pages
   ○ Cut useful for column data, csv… tabbed data, but you can cut out a certain column using this command
   ○ Sed stream editor, can edit an input stream’s data, or just do search and replace within a document
   ○ Uniq gives output of only unique data, really useful for column data again
   ○ Tac &lt;-reverse of cat, going from the bottom to the top</li>
      <li>Regex
   ○ . (dot) - a single character.
   ○ ? - the preceding character matches 0 or 1 times only.
   ○ * - the preceding character matches 0 or more times.
   ○ + - the preceding character matches 1 or more times.
   ○ {n} - the preceding character matches exactly n times.
   ○ {n,m} - the preceding character matches at least n times and not more than m times.
   ○ [agd] - the character is one of those included within the square brackets.
   ○ [^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets.
   ○ [c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f.
   ○ () - allows us to group several characters to behave as one.
   ○ | (pipe symbol) - the logical OR operation.
   ○ ^ - matches the beginning of the line.
   ○ $ - matches the end of the line.</li>
      <li>Piping!! And Redirection
   ○ Every program that we run in the commandline has 3 different streams that can be connected to it
   ○ STDIN standard input data fed into the program
   ○ STDOUT standard output data outputted from the program
   ○ STDERR which are the error output stream
   ○ Redirecting to a file
        <ul>
          <li>If we wish to take the output stream of a application and save it to a file we will use the ‘&gt;’ greater than symbol to a file that you want as the output</li>
          <li>If we redirect to afile that’s name isn’t already created then a new file will be created for you, however if redirecting to an existing file that file will be over written 
      □ But we can get the data appended to the file using the » operator
   ○ Redirecting from a file</li>
          <li>Using the ‘&lt;’ less than operator we can actually redirect a file to be as an input to a program, we redirect into the stdin stream
   ○ Redirecting to standard error</li>
          <li>Using the 2&gt; operator where we identify the stream by its number stream 2 being the err stream, we can direct an error the error stream which will be printed out on the commandline</li>
          <li>ls -l video.mpg blah.foo &gt; myoutput 2&gt;&amp;1 will redirect the output stream of err into the output file stream to be saved into the file myoutput
   ○ Piping</li>
          <li>
            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>We can pipe the output of one file into another file using the</td>
                  <td>operator, it will pipe the output from the application on the left into the one on the right</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Process management
   ○ Top &lt;-shows processes in ram gives a live output
   ○ PS aux to show all processes running
   ○ Killing a process can be done with kill <pid> or we can truly kill by kill -9 <pid> which is a force kill which will not wait and kill it
   ○ Running processes in the background
</pid></pid>        <ul>
          <li>You can run processes in the background by adding the &amp; operator at the end of a commandline to move the process in the background</li>
          <li>To move a job or process back into the foreground use the ‘fg’ command with the job id to bring that process into the foreground</li>
          <li>Ctrl z will bring the currently running foreground application into the background</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bash Scripting
