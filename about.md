# Hello

## Terry here.

Not sure what I can write in the beginning without sound either too nerdy, not funny, or serious. I am just the average joe programmer with the BURNING passion for technology, literally woven into me. I think I would say at the time that I am rewriting this first paragraph, I would describe "current year" to be the year of Javascript, VR, and machine learning which I hope by the time whoever is reading this, those 3 subjects are no longer the dominating factors of the year.

I *was* a computer science student at McMaster University in the lovely city of Hamilton Ontario. I <s>am<s> was a hackathon goer, community volunteer, coding mentor, and the president of McMaster’s largest tech community PhaseOne formerly known as HackItMac. If you ever really want to know more about me look at the resources I’ve laid out for you below. If you want to talk to me, drop me a email at <me@tairuitong.me>

You know, doing the thing with the stack. Currently working on Spring Boot applications, writing secure and correct rest API end points. Have the ability to clearly communicate to PO's regarding specification and render a mvp that actually fits their needs. Also am able to create front ends that just about does anything the PO wants, it just takes some espresso shots to get all the Javascript sorted out.
